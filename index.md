## Currently

Now I am a student at the ATC Language School, I have been studying English for six months and have made great progress. Thanks to my teachers, when I first came here I could barely understand English at all, now I have reached A2 plus level.  I have applied for another six months language course, which will last 24 weeks from 6.26.  I think I should have a good level of English after six months.

### Specialized in

Golang, C#, Network technology, such as packet capture and VPN, Good at using linux, usually use linux to develop software.
I am a backend engineer with 7 years of work experience.

As my language is not very good, I won't write too much about it.  I'm going to renew my student visa at the language school next week, so I'll be able to intern here for about six months.  This will give me enough time to prove my ability to work.  I also know front-end development, such as HTML, javascript, css, VUE.

In my past work experience I have often mentored new colleagues with little work experience.


### Research interests

Network technology, Reading programming books. swimming, Japanese anime, Nature, I especially like flowers and small animals, and almost every week I go to Phoenix Park to feed carrots to the deer.
